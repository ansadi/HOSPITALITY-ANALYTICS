# HOSPITALITY-ANALYTICS

##𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐨: 
The AtliQ Grands Hospitality Project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative focused on AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels operating across India in major cities such as Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Mumbai. This project utilizes Microsoft Power BI to provide detailed insights into hotel performance, including metrics like revenue, ratings, and customer satisfaction.
## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 : 
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. 

## Key Insights:
* Mumbai best city as per Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, DURN & Avg Rating.(But AtliQ Bay And Atliq City not performing well in Mumbai).
* Delhi tops in Occupancy% and Hyderabad in Realization%.
* Atliq Exotica best Property (Except in Hyderabad).
* Booking Platform “Others” is the best.
* “Presidential” room Class has highest ADR and Occupancy% and Average rating.
* Occupancy% and Avg Rating is positively Correlated.
* There is no % Change in parameters like ADR,DSRN on WoW basis. But Significant change can be seen in Parameters like Occupancy% and RevPAR.
* Since ADR is stagnant in all the months and Occupancy% is changing, we can conclude that AtliQ Grand is more focused on long term Gains.
* Weekend is better than weekday in every aspect (especially RevPAR & Occupancy%).
* Avg Rating :  Lowest 2.29 (Atliq Season),
                Highest 3.96(Atliq Blu) ||
                Lowest 3.41 (Bangalore),
                Highest  3.78 (Delhi)
                
* Highest Revenue : May (581.7Mil) ||
                    Atliq Exotica (320.25Mil) ||
                    Mumbai (668.64Mil)

Overall Recommendation:
* Give more importance to booking Platform “others”
* Engage more with Bengaluru Customers with an aim to increase Average Rating.
* Atliq Season is the worst performing Property. Try to give discount (It will negatively impact ADR) to increase Occupancy% for short term. 
* To generate more revenue in long run don’t compromise with ADR to improve Occupancy & Revenue. 
* Atliq Exotica is the best property especially in Mumbai, but it performs worst in Hyderabad. Check who is responsible for it and punish him.
* Mumbai is the best city for AtliQ Grand, but Atliq Bay and Atliq Season are not performing well. Need to correct it now.
* Use vacant rooms as corporate office space on weekdays thus by increasing Occupancy% , RevPAR, Revenue and DURN.
* Try to minimize gap between Total Revenue and Net Revenue.
